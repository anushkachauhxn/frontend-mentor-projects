## 💡 My process

### 🏗️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### 🤓 What I learned

- Properly sectioning the complete webpage makes it easier to tackle.

- I divided the whole design into _header_, _main_ and _footer_. Then divided main and footer into different sections. This gave me a clear sight of what needed to be done and the amount of progress I had made.

- Proper naming of all sections, divs and even buttons helps make the styling very easy.

- While styling the webpage, I noticed patterns in the sections and took advantage of them by using classes like `cta-btn` and styling common elements in the beginning like `heading tags`, `ul`, `a`, `button`, etc.

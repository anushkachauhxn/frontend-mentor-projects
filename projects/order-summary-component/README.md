## üí° My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The major lesson I learnt from this project was to plan the placement of elements roughly beforehand, like where you want to use Flexbox and where you need to use absolute display etc.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning and getting better at CSS Application. I'm more comfortable with simple CSS and vanilla JS. So I want to practice using frameworks like React, Material UI etc.

### What I learned

Got seriously better at using CSS Grid.

#### 😎 Proud of this CSS:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 100%;
  margin: 40px;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 254px);
  grid-gap: 24px 30px;
  grid-template-areas:
    "daniel daniel jonathan kira"
    "jeanette patrick patrick kira";
}
```

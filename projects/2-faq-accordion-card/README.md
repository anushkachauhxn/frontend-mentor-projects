## üí° My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Framework

### What I learned

I used Bootstrap for the accordion open and close feature. I learnt how to read the documentation and take what parts you need and leave the extra. This was very valuable as I did not want the Bootstrap CSS in the card, but only the collapse functionality.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning and getting better at CSS Application. I'm more comfortable with simple CSS and vanilla JS. So I want to practice using frameworks like React, Material UI etc.
